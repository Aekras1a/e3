# E<sup>3</sup> Framework

E<sup>3</sup> (Encrypt-Everything-Everywhere) is a framework 
providing C++ classes for supporting computation on private 
data. E<sup>3</sup> is usability-oriented, allowing 
programmers to incorporate privacy to their 
programs without expertise in cryptography.

In its first version, E<sup>3</sup> encrypts variables 
using Fully Homomorphic Encryption and provides 
a rich set of C++ operators to the programmer.

If you use our framework, please cite our paper 
titled "E<sup>3</sup>: A Framework for Compiling C++ 
Programs with Encrypted Operands", which can be found 
here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1013.
The paper describes the process of using E<sup>3</sup>,
as well as how to add new libraries to the framework.
