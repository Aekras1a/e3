# E<sup>3</sup> Framework

E<sup>3</sup> (Encrypt-Everything-Everywhere) is a framework providing C++ classes for supporting computation on private data. E^3 is usability-oriented, allowing programmers to incorporate privacy to their programs without expertise in cryptography.

In its first version, E^3 encrypts variables using Fully Homomorphic Encryption and provides a rich set of C++ operators to the programmer.

If you use our framework, please cite our paper titled "E^3: A Framework for Compiling C++ Programs with Encrypted Operands", which can be found here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1013. The paper describes the process of using E^3, as well as how to add new libraries to the framework.
